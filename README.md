# Spring Boot and Hibernate Learning Tracker

This repository is dedicated to tracking my learning progress in Java Spring Boot 3, Spring 6, and Hibernate.

## Java Spring Boot 3

Java Spring Boot 3 is a powerful framework designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of a new Spring application. The framework takes an opinionated approach to configuration, freeing developers from the need to define boilerplate configuration.

## Spring 6

Spring 6 is the next major version of the Spring Framework. It's not released yet, but it's expected to bring significant improvements and new features to the framework.

## Hibernate

Hibernate is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java application to interact with the database. It is an open-source, lightweight, ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool.
