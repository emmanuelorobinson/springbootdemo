# Spring App

The section of the Spring App is a demonstration of a Spring application. It covers several key aspects of Spring development.

- Dependency Injection: This is a fundamental aspect of the Spring framework, allowing loose coupling of code components.

- Qualifiers: These are used when we have multiple beans of the same type and want to wire only one of them with a property.

- Lazy Initialization: This is a feature in Spring that allows a bean to be initialized only when it is first requested, rather than at startup.

- Bean Life Cycle Methods: These are methods that you can define in your bean class to tap into the lifecycle of a bean, like initialization and destruction.

- Java Config Bean: This is a modern way of Spring configuration which allows you to write most of your Spring configuration without XML but with the help of few Java-based annotations.
