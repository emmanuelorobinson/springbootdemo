# Part Three - Hibernate JPA CRUD Application

This section of the project contains a Hibernate JPA CRUD application. 

## Overview

This application is built using Spring Boot and Hibernate, demonstrating the use of JPA for object-relational mapping and CRUD operations.

## Features

### Hibernate JPA

The application uses Hibernate as its JPA implementation for handling database operations. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations like create, read, update, and delete.

### MySQL Connector

The application uses the MySQL Connector/J, a JDBC Type 4 driver that converts JDBC calls into the network protocol used by the MySQL database.

### Spring Boot Starter Data JPA

The application uses Spring Boot Starter Data JPA to simplify database operations. It provides a powerful repository and custom object-mapping abstraction.
